            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>mitaaniX, is an organization that seeks to empower children, youths and women living in the streets through art with its innate power of healing and growth; and to provide access and linkage to a continuum of care through a Child's Rights Approach.</p>
            <p>The name of our organization is coined from the swahili word 'mitaani' that means 'streets' and 'X' representing our joint efforts towards enabling families living in the streets to find alternative means, and no to the kids being on the streets.The 'TAA' within 'mitaani' is another swahili word that means 'light', the emblem of hope we endeavor to be in a dark world. </p>
            <p>Our focus is to inculcate in them the skills and attitudes required to build the lives that the children living in the streets envision, brick by brick, within our capacity; and to painstakingly look into their living situations in the streets as well as at home, for appropriate linkage to the best care that ensures holistic growth. Our end goal is to get these children a permanent source of basic needs (food, shelter and clothing) as well as other needs such as education, economic empowerment and health (complete mental,physical and social well being as per the WHO definition). We aim at protecting the children by addressing common ills that they face, including but not limited to: sexual abuse (rape and sodomy), exploitation, police brutality, mob justice, inhumane round ups/ arbitrary removal from the streets, delayed legal justice, trafficking and non existent protective laws; through reinforcement of the community capacities, for united, great things are accomplished.</p>

            <p>Day and night, street children, youths and women face a myriad of risks by living in the streets. Most are in search for solace but instead face injustice within the streets such as;</p>

            <h7>CONCLUSION</h7>
            <P>We believe that the trials we face in life, grant us the opportunity to persevere and when we persevere it creates character, which leads to hope. In a world where children living in the streets face only hardship and are viewed as an eyesore, it is easy to be incarcerated by a mentality of hopelessness.</P>
            <P>However, once one has persevered there will be hope for the future. We do our best to help these street children to turn their failures into victories.  We are the light at the end of the tunnel, the tunnel that we are also building.</P>
